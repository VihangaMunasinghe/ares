# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Currently, security updates are provided for the following versions of ARES:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of ARES seriously. If you believe you've found a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do Not Disclose Publicly**: Please do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed.

2. **Contact Information**: Email your findings to the project maintainers at [vihanga.munasinghe@nasa.gov](mailto:vihanga.munasinghe@nasa.gov). If you don't receive a response within 48 hours, please follow up.

3. **Provide Details**: In your report, please include:
   - A description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact of the vulnerability
   - Any potential solutions you've identified (optional)

4. **Response Time**: You can expect an initial response to your report within 48 hours, acknowledging receipt of your vulnerability report.

5. **Disclosure Timeline**:
   - We will work with you to understand and validate the vulnerability.
   - Once validated, we aim to release a patch within 14 days, depending on complexity.
   - After the patch is released, we will publicly acknowledge your contribution (if desired).

## Security Best Practices

When deploying ARES, consider the following security best practices:

### 1. Environment Security
Ensure your deployment environment follows security best practices, including:
- Using HTTPS for all communications
- Setting up proper authentication for APIs
- Restricting access to sensitive endpoints
- Implementing proper firewall configurations

### 2. Database Security
- Use strong, unique passwords for database connections
- Enable SSL/TLS for database connections
- Implement proper database access controls
- Regularly backup database with encryption

### 3. API Security
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Validate all input data
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Use secure headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)

### 4. Dependencies
- Keep all dependencies updated to their latest secure versions
- Regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- Use dependency scanning tools in your CI/CD pipeline

### 5. Data Protection
- Be mindful of the mission-critical data being processed
- Ensure you have appropriate security clearances and follow NASA data protection regulations
- Implement data encryption at rest and in transit
- Follow proper data retention and disposal policies

### 6. Infrastructure Security
- Use container security best practices if using Docker
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Regular security assessments and penetration testing
- Follow the principle of least privilege

### 7. NASA-Specific Considerations
- Follow NASA IT Security guidelines and policies
- Ensure compliance with government security standards
- Implement proper audit trails for mission-critical operations
- Consider classification levels of mission data

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediate Response**: Isolate affected systems and assess the scope of the incident
2. **Documentation**: Document all actions taken and evidence collected
3. **Notification**: Notify the appropriate NASA security teams and stakeholders
4. **Recovery**: Implement recovery procedures and validate system integrity
5. **Post-Incident**: Conduct a thorough post-incident review and update security measures
